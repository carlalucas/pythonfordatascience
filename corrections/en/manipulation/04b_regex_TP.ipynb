This was possible with the `str.find` method from the `Pandas` package, which is a vectorized version of the basic `find` method. We could also use the basic method directly, especially when performing *web scraping*.\n",

For instance, if we want to find both the singular and plural occurrences of a term, we will need to use the `find` method at least twice. For conjugated verbs, it becomes even more complex, especially if their form changes according to the subject.\n",
        "\n",
        "For complicated expressions, it is advisable to use **regular expressions** or *“regex”*. This is a feature found in many programming languages. It is a form of grammar that allows for searching for patterns.\n",

A regular expression takes the form of a string, which can contain both literal elements and special characters with logical meaning.\n",
